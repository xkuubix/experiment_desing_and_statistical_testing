# Experiment Design

The data analysed in this project were synthetically generated based on a real study on youth athletes sport performance. The analysis focuses on measurements of the force produced by the gastrocnemius muscle (musculus gastrocnemius, referred to in Polish as brzuchaty ≈Çydki, BR). These data were generated using the mean and standard deviation calculated from real dataset measurements.

The measurements are expressed in normalized units of kilogram force (kg/kg).
Each participant contributed two measurements: one for the left extremity and one for the right extremity. These can be categorized as belonging to either the dominant or non-dominant extremity, depending on the participant's functional dominance.
Here, the null hypothesis is that the mean force measurements of the dominant and non-dominant extremities do not differ. The alternative hypothesis states that there is a significant difference between the two means. Given that the two groups are dependent (each participant contributes to both groups), a paired statistical test was used. For parametric data, a paired t-test was intended, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for non-parametric data. Before selecting the appropriate statistical test, the following assumptions were evaluated:
1. Normality of data: The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to determine whether the force measurements followed a normal distribution.
2. Homogeneity of variances: The Levene's test was performed to assess whether the variances of the two groups were equal.

## Results

Summarised data is presented in the form of a density plot for both extremities, dominant and nondominant (see **Figure 1**). A minimal sample size of ùëõ = 280 was determined to consistently yield statistically significant results (ùëù<.05) in at least 10 consecutive repetitions of the test. Although ùëõ = 140 was the first sample size to achieve 10 consecutive successes, for ùëõ ‚â• 280, no instances of fewer than 10 out of 10 successes were observed (see **Figure 2**). The Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed a
significant difference (ùëâ = 25301; ùëù < .001). This indicates that the true location shift between the groups is not equal to zero. The findings indicate that there is a statistically significant difference in the force measurements between the dominant and non-dominant extremities in youth athletes. These results suggest potential asymmetry in muscle strength.
